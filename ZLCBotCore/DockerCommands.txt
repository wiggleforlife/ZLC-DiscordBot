To run the docker instance inside a command prompt:
	1) Git Clone the Repository
		- If it is private and you have TFA you will need a Token from GitHub.
		- NOTE: The file "config.json" is not in the GitHub Repo. YOU will need to create it and put in the required configuration items.
	2) Make sure "Docker" is installed on the computer you are running it from.
	3) Open Command Prompt
	4) Navigate to the folder from GitHub
		- Make sure your current directory is the directory with "docker-compose.yml" and "Dockerfile".
		- i.e. C:/ZLC-DiscordBot/ZLCBotCore
	5) Enter the Command "docker-compose build"
		- This will build the GitHub repo so it can be ran inside a docker container.
	6) Enter the Command "docker-compose up"
		- This will create the instance inside the command terminal.
