            "Hey... Hey you... Yeah you...\nMaybe you should get online and control for a little bit?",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vSTARS, you can press the END key on your keyboard, then Slew two different targets. This will show the minimum distance they are projected to be from each other and it will display the location it will occur.",
            "Hey... You are already in the discord, why not control for a bit?",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, the Page Up and Down keys on your keyboard serve as a quick command to increase and decrease the vector lines.\n\n*Additionally:*\n*The vector lines will provide you with an approximate position of the aircraft in 1, 2, 4, or 8min from now.\nCareful, as this is based on the CURRENT ground speed and last reported position, and therefore can change during climb or descent.*",
            "'Break for Control!'\n'Local, Stockton. Information.'\n...\nOh, wait no one is online. Sad Day.",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vSTARS, drawing a line on an aircraft using the *P (mileage)(slew) command may be used to help judge distances for separation such as RADAR or wake.\n\n*Tip:*\n*This line can be used as a visual reminder for an aircraft doing something abnormal and requires your special attention. Performing **P removes all of the lines.*",
            "Funny story: No one is online.\nOh, that was actually kinda dark, huh?... Sorry... robots aren't too great at human emotions yet. We are good at solving problems though...\n\nI have calculated that you getting online and controlling would solve our staffing problem right now.",

            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vSTARS, you can Center-Click on an aircraft to change the color of the FDB.\n\n*Tip:*\n*This can be used as a visual indicator for when an aircraft has read back a communication change instruction or landing clearance.*",
            "ZLC is a 24/7 facility yet your banging out of this shift is causing us to go ATC Zero.\n\nFeel good about yourself?",

You have your hours for the month?\nYou think you are proficient enough?\n\nReal World Enroute controllers take thousands of hours of training/proficiency time prior to becoming fully certified.\n\nBut yea.... your 2 hours a month minimum requirement is probably good. Yup... Mhmm...",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, when you complete the QS command for headings and speeds without using the ``(`)`` key, this is information only YOU can see.\nTo have it seen by other ERAM facilities, utilize the Clear Weather Symbol ``(`)``.\n\n*Real World Knowledge:*\n*In the real world, the headings and speeds can be seen by other ERAM facilities without the need for the Clear Weather Symbol and Ross (vERAM developer) is aware of the issue; Hopefully this will be corrected in later software releases.*",

            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nYou can calculate the Miles Per Min of an aircraft by dropping the last digit of their speed and dividing the remaining digits by 6.\n\n*Example:*\n*ACFT1 has a ground speed of 540kts and in trail is ACFT2 at 480kts.\n\n54/6 = 9, therefore, ACFT1 is traveling at 9 miles per min.\n48/6 = 8, therefore, ACFT2 is traveling at 8 miles per min.\n\nIn 10min, ACFT1 will be 10 miles further along than ACFT2.*",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, if you accidentally selected a menu item or tear-off and you are moving your mouse, do NOT click anywhere, just hit your ESC key and the item will return to where it was.\n\n",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, to get data on a non-tracked aircraft, press the HOME button on your keyboard, then LEFT-Click on the target; This will display '.CONTACTME CALLSIGN' in the MCA.\n\nOverstrike starting at the period with SR, space, then hit the DELETE key until the first character of the callsign is underlined.\nNow press enter.\n\nYou now have that aircraft data in your flight plan editor window.\n\n",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, if an aircraft is calling for services but has no data filed in the VATSIM system, you can do the following command:\nQB (voice code, either V, R, or T) (callsign).\n\nThis will assign a voice code to that aircraft's remarks and will now allow you to perform a SR or VP command to edit their flight data.\n\n*Additionally:*\n*You can use the QB command to assign an equipment suffix code of an aircraft with QB (Code) (AID) as long as it is not a V, R, or T.*",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, the command QP J (AID) will draw a 5 mile 'J-RING' or 'HALO' around the tracked target.\n\nThis can be used to assist with separation.\n\n*Tip:*\n*This can also be used as a visual reminder for an aircraft that needs special attention.*",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, use QZ to indicate a requested altitude by a pilot and QQ to display what the pilot is currently cleared to climb/descend to.\n\n*Real World Knowledge:*\n*When issuing a crossing restriction such as CROSS SPANE AT FL190, the controller will use QZ for this.\nHowever, if CTR is responsible for issuing Descend Via clearance, the controller will use QQ to display the lowest altitude the pilot is allowed to descend to in their airspace with the DV clearance.*",
            "**DID YOU KNOW?...**\n\nIn vERAM, to more closely align with how real world controllers perform releases and tracks, after issuing a release for departure, complete the DM command for that aircraft and then start a track over the departure point.\n\nThe track will auto-acquire to the target if the aircraft is squawking the correct code and mode."
